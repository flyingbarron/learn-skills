description: Q&A reference for the DataStage parallel engine — parallelism, partitioning theory, APT configuration files, concurrent job execution, restart/recovery, disk/resource tuning, dataset performance, flow optimization (partitioning/sorting/memory), and per-stage semantics. Use for conceptual engine questions and stage property lookups regardless of authoring tool.

# DataStage Parallel Engine

## When to Use DataStage
- Batch ETL processing of large data volumes
- Parallel processing across multiple nodes
- Complex transformations with high throughput requirements
- Integration with enterprise databases and file systems
- Data warehouse loading and CDC operations

## Engine Characteristics
- **Parallel processing**: Divides data into partitions processed simultaneously
- **Pipeline parallelism**: Multiple stages process different data concurrently
- **Scalable**: Add nodes to increase throughput
- **High performance**: Optimized for large-scale data movement

## Key Concepts
- **Partitioning**: Data divided across processing nodes
- **Nodes**: Physical or logical processing units
- **Partitions**: Subsets of data processed independently
- **Configuration file**: Defines nodes and resources

## Performance Factors
- Job design (stage selection, partitioning, data flow)
- Configuration (node count, partition count, resources)
- Infrastructure (disk I/O, network bandwidth, CPU)
